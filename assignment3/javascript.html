	Just as individuated texts have become filaments of infinitely tangled webs, so the digital machines of the late twentieth cen­tury weave new networks from what were once isolated words, numbers, music, shapes, smells, tactile textures, architectures, and countless channels as yet unnamed. Media become interac­tive and hyperactive, the multiplicitous components of an im­mersive zone which "does not begin <i>with</i> writing; it is directly related rather to the weaving of elaborate figured silks." The yarn is neither metaphorical nor literal, but quite simply mate­rial, a gathering of threads which twist and turn through the history of computing, technology, the sciences and arts. In and out of the punched holes of automated looms, up and down through the ages of spinning and weaving, back and forth through the fabrication of fabrics, shuttles and looms, cotton and silk, canvas and paper, brushes and pens,  typewriters, carriages, telephone wites, synthetic fibers, electrical filaments, silicon strands, fiber-optic cables, pixeled screens, telecom lines,
	the World Wide Web, the Net, and matrices to come.

	When the first of the cyberpunk novels, William Gibson's Neuromancer was published in 1984, the cyberspace it described was neither an actually existing plane, nor a zone plucked out of the thin airs of myth and fantasy. It was a virtual reality which was itself increasingly real. Personal computers were becoming as ubiquitous as telephones, military simulation technologies and telecommunications networks were known to be highly sophisticated, and arcade games were addictive and increasingly immersive. Neuromancer was a fiction, and also another piece of the jigsaw which allowed these components to converge. In the course of the next decade, computers lost their significance as isolated calculators and word processors to become nodes of the  the vast global network called the Net. Video, still images, sounds, voices, and texts fused into the interactive multimedia which now seemed destined to converge with virtual reality helmets and data suits, sensory feedback mechanisms and neural connec­tions, immersive digital realities continuous with reality itself. Whatever that was now supposed to be.

	At the time, it was widely assumed that machines ran on more or less straightforward lines. Fictions might be speculative and inspire particular developments, but they were not supposed to have such immediate effects. Like all varieties of cultural change, technological development was supposed to proceed step after step and one at a time. It was only logical, after all.  But cyberspace changed all this. It suddenly seemed as if all the components and tendencies which were now feeding into this virtual zone had been made for it before it had even been named; as though all the ostensible reasons and motivations underlying their development had merely provided occasions for the emergence of a matrix which Gibson's novel was nudging into place; as though the present was being reeled into a future which had always been guiding the past, washing back over precedents completely unaware of its infuence.

		Neuromancer was neither the first nor the last of such con­fusions between fiction and fact, future and past. When Gibson described <quote>'bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless void'</quote>, his cyberspace was already implementing earlier -- or later works of nonfiction: Alan Turing's universal machine had drawn the devices of his day -- calculators and typewriters -- into a virtual system which brought itself on-line in the Second World War; Ada's Analythical Engine, which backed the punched-card processes of the automated weaving machine; and Jacquard's loom, which gathered itself on the gathering threads of weavers who in turn were picking up on the threads of the spiders andd moths and webs of bacterial activity.
