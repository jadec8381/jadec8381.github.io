    instruction
  </p>
  <p>
    Clean the fish and drained it thoroughly. Cut ginger into slices. Pour some oil on a pan and fry ginger slices for around 30 seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
    	Carefully slide the drained fish in. Let it stay for around 30 seconds over medium fire until one side becomes slightly brown. 
  </p>

<h4>
  <p>
    	Turn the fish over and continue frying the second side. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Pour around 2 L of BOILED water or enough water to almost cover the fish body.     
  </p>
  <p>
    Add salt and pepper.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add tofu and slow down your fire slightly, cook for around 25 to 30 minutes until the soup becomes creamy white. Discard ginger slices.
