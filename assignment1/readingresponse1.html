The reading serves as a review for me since I have learned most of the stuff on it last semester. Yet, I have forgot some of the things so the reading gave me an opportunity to refresh my memories regarding html codes. For examples, I forgot some of the tags like <h1>-<h4>, and when I was going through the keynote from class I was quite confused about it (by confused I mean I know I learned those tags last semester but I just forgot about it). I also learned something new, which is chapter 7. It was the issue that I have encountered with while I was trying to link my homework response in the child directory to the main page. That chapter solved the problem I had and the content was explained in a well-understood way.
