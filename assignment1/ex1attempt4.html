<p>Clean the fish and drained it thoroughly. Cut ginger into slices. Pour some oil on a pan and fry ginger slices for around 30 seconds. Carefully slide the drained fish in. Let it stay for around 30 seconds over medium fire until one side becomes slightly brown. Turn the fish over and continue frying the second side. Pour around 2 L of BOILED water or enough water to almost cover the fish body. Add salt and pepper. Add tofu and slow down your fire slightly, cook for around 25 to 30 minutes until the soup becomes creamy white. Discard ginger slices.</p>
