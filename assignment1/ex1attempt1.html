<p>How to Make Fish Soup</p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<p>1 fresh fish (300g), 1/2 white radish, 4 slices of ginger, 1 green onion, salt, cold water, 1 teaspoon cooking oil.</p>
<p>Instructions</p>
<p>Scale the fish and remove the black membrane in the inner side. Drain thoroughly with paper and set it aside. Peel the tough skin of white radish and then cut into shreds. Brush some oil on a pan and fry ginger slices for around 30 seconds. Carefully slide the drained fish in. Let it stay for around 30 seconds over medium fire until one side becomes slightly brown. Turn the fish over and continue frying the second side. Pour around 2 L of cold water or enough water to almost cover the fish body. Add cooking wine, green onion and then turn up the fire and bring it to boil. Add white radish shreds and slow down your fire slightly, cook for around 25 to 30 minutes until the soup becomes creamy white. Discard ginger slices and green onion. Add salt and decorate with fresh coriander leaves before serving.</p>
